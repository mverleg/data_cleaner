What do I want with the data cleanup tool I was building? Automate the manual process of plotting data before and after applying operations? It'll never be as flexible as doing it through programming, though it may be substantially faster (human-faster that is). Does it also do learning? And presentation? I should add a description field to variables anyway, and probably let people choose visualizations, so maybe start with that (.rst) and see if it grows into a visualizer. Do I want to go into multi-column operations like TSNE or PCA? That'll probably make it go way out of control... But things like PCA or correlations with other variables are needed anyway... PCA would be multiple columns to multiple new ones. Correlations would be shown as context, not part of output.
